# DietTrack
This is a simple project for some data Science school subject. It is intended to keep 
track of my diet for almos 30 days. I Created a Class and made use of a nutritionix 
Library(https://github.com/leetrout/python-nutritionix). I save my data in a csv file.
You also have to make use of the nutritionix api.
